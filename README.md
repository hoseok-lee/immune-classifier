# Objective

> Binary classification of histopathology images cells as immune or non-immune
based on learned morphological features. We performed cross-validation across 
two imaging domains, hematoxylin & eosin (H&E) staining and peripheral blood 
smears (PBS), to investigate whether learned features are transferable.

# Datasets

1. [Immunocto](https://zenodo.org/records/11073373) (H&E)
2. [Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eugeneshenderov/acute-promyelocytic-leukemia-apl) (PBS)

# Model

We used an ensemble model consisting of ResNet18 and a simple vision 
transformer (ViT) with `pytorch`. All code for model architecture and training
is included.
